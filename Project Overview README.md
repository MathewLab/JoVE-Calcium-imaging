Drosophila Larval Calcium Imaging

A method for calcium imaging in Drosophila larvae using tissue adhesive to hold samples still. Reduces motion problems during imaging.

What's included:

Immobilization technique with tissue adhesive
Works with standard confocal microscopes
Custom R scripts for analyzing calcium signals
Low-cost setup

What it does:
Records calcium changes in larval brain neurons. Can test responses to odors and other stimuli.
