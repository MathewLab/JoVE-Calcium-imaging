Manual QC workflow in ImajeJ
1.	XY displacement check (lateral drift)
•	After StackReg, play the movie back quickly (Image ▸ Stacks ▸ Tools ▸ Animation Options).
•	Look for the ROI “sliding” relative to landmarks (tracheae, neuropil edges).
•	If you see residual shifts that StackReg didn’t fix (jumps, frame jitter), flag that dataset.
2.	Z-drift (focus/axial stability)
•	Scroll through frames (or play movie) and watch for the structure going out of focus, blurring, or shrinking.
•	Z-drift often looks like signal intensity fades and fine structure vanishes, then sometimes comes back.
•	If the signal declines irreversibly → flag/exclude.
3.	Signal quality / bleaching
•	Plot the ROI trace (Analyze ▸ Plot Profile) or use the ROI Manager’s Multi-Measure.
•	Check if baseline intensity drops steeply (>30%) over the recording.
•	If signal decays to noise floor or fails to respond to stimulus → exclude.
4.	Declining responses
•	If you have stimulus epochs, check ΔF/F responses over time.
•	If early trials are clear but responses vanish by the end → flag.
